# YangBA Data Fetcher (frontend)

This repository is for the frontend aspect of the YangBA Data Fetcher website, primarily implemented using React + Typescript. When a user first opens the website, there is a home page that introduces each of 3 separate "paths" or tools that the user can choose to query a specific type of stat. Specifically, there is the "Stats," "Games," and "Rank" component that queries a specific stat from an individual player, lists out different statlines that satisfy given criteria, and ranks players based on given criteria, respectively.

There is also a page for example queries in case the user wants to get some inspiration or have a clearer understanding of what the project entails. Furthermore, there is an option to search for different players on the navbar, resulting in a unique player profile. The layout has a purple + dark blue theme, with a dark image in the background of each page for visual effects as well.
